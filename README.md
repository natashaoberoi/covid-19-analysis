# covid-19-analysis

## Project Overview:

In March of 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States and changed everything, causing widespread illness and death, economic disruption, isolation, and long-lasting impacts on healthcare, employment, education, etc. By leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn, this project aims to analyze COVID-19 deaths in the United States and factors contributing to those deaths in order to contribute to our understanding of the pandemic's dynamics and derive insights about them. The dataset used is the "Conditions Contributing to COVID-19 Deaths, by State and Age, Provisional 2020-2023" dataset from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website which can be found [here](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Conditions-Contributing-to-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Stat/hk9y-quqm/about_data)

## Project Structure:
The project is structured within a Jupyter Notebook environment and includes the following components:

1. Data Collection and Storage:
  * Raw data related to the COVID-19 pandemic is collected from reliable sources such as official health organizations.
  * Data is stored and managed within the Jupyter Notebook environment using Pandas DataFrames.
2. Data Analysis:
  * Python code cells within the Jupyter Notebook are used to retrieve and analyze data.
  * Pandas and NumPy libraries are employed for data manipulation and statistical analysis.
3. Visualization:
  * Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn libraries are utilized to create visualizations directly within the Jupyter Notebook.
  * Visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps are generated to represent trends, patterns, and correlations in the COVID-19 data.

## Requirements:
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Python 3
* SQLite
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository
2. Launch Jupyter Notebooks
